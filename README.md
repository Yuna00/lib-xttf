# Project focus
The main goal of this font rendering library is to be easy to understand and avoid unnecessary functionality. This is primarily because of TrueType having a lot of optional functionality that *could* be implemented, but would exponentially increase the complexity of the codebase. I want to take something complex and make it simple.
